# Project1-customers_segmentation-RFM

The dataset contains several informations about customers transactions. Each customer has their own characteristic while doing a transaction, such as, loyal customers will spend a lot of money in single transaction because they got a lot of money or a student will spend as minimun money as they can in single transaction to save their money for living.
So thegoal of this project is to cluster the customers with the same characteristic while doing transaction. The clusters is based on RFM(recency, frequency, and monetary). So I hope taht this project will help the decission maker to treat each cluster of customers differently to earn optimum profit.
