# Project1-customers_segmentation-RFM

The dataset contains several informations about customers transactions. Each customer has their own characteristic while doing a transaction, such as, loyal customers will spend a lot of money in single transaction because they got a lot of money or a student will spend as minimun money as they can in single transaction to save their money for living.
So thegoal of this project is to cluster the customers with the same characteristic while doing transaction. The clusters is based on RFM(recency, frequency, and monetary). So I hope that this project will help the decission maker to treat each cluster of customers differently to earn optimum profit.

First step for doing machine learning or any data science problem is to define WHAT QUESTION SHOULD I ANSWER FROM THIS PROJECT. So I define some questions that will be answered. The questions are
1. Which time and month has the best selling ?
2. How's the distribution of recency, frequency, and monetary ?
3. How many cluster is the best ?
4. How's the characteristic of each cluster?
After that we can start analyzing the data and try to answer those questions.

The dataset contains 8 features
